DPDK Release 24.11
==================

.. **Read this first.**

   The text in the sections below explains how to update the release notes.

   Use proper spelling, capitalization and punctuation in all sections.

   Variable and config names should be quoted as fixed width text:
   ``LIKE_THIS``.

   Build the docs and view the output file to ensure the changes are correct::

      ninja -C build doc
      xdg-open build/doc/guides/html/rel_notes/release_24_11.html


New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs (ordered alphabetically by vendor name)
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significant)

     Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
     =======================================================

* **Extended service cores statistics.**

  Two new per-service counters are added to the service cores framework.

  * ``RTE_SERVICE_ATTR_IDLE_CALL_COUNT`` tracks the number of service function
    invocations where no actual work was performed.

  * ``RTE_SERVICE_ATTR_ERROR_CALL_COUNT`` tracks the number invocations
    resulting in an error.

  The new statistics are useful for debugging and profiling.

* **Added support for compiler memcpy in DPDK memcpy implementation.**

  The memory copy functions of ``<rte_memcpy.h>`` now optionally
  delegates to the standard memcpy() function, implemented by the
  compiler and the C runtime (e.g., libc).

  In this release of DPDK, the handcrafted, per-architecture memory
  copy implementations are still the default. Compiler memcpy is
  enabled by setting the new ``use_cc_memcpy`` build option to true.

  The performance benefits of the custom DPDK rte_memcpy()
  implementations have been diminishing with every new compiler
  release, and with current toolchains the use of a custom memcpy()
  implementation may even result in worse performance than the
  standard memcpy().

  An additional benefit of using compiler memcpy is that compilers and
  static analysis tools have an easier time detecting incorrect usage
  of rte_memcpy() (e.g., buffer overruns, or overlapping source and
  destination buffers).
